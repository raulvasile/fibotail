# Tail Call optimization with Fibonacci Sequence as example

This is just a simple example of how powerful can Tail Call optimization be
for a small problem like generating the Nth Fibonacci term.

A PDF presentation is also attached to the repo.

Also, the source code is written in two different programming languages, one is
`JavaScript` and the other one is `Haskell`. The main reason for this is because
for Live Demo part, in JavaScript, if you are trying to show the value for a
bigger input, such as `1500` or higher, the output will be Infinity (because of the
limitation of Integer in JS)

Hint: for GHCi users, if you want to see how long the execution took
use `:set +s` in GHCi console
