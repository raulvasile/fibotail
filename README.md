# Tail Call optimisation with Fibonacci Sequence as example

This is just a simple example of how powerful can be Tail Call optimisation
for a small problem like generating the Nth Fibonacci number

Made for a small workshop, I'll provide more infos about as soon as possible

Hint: for GHCi users, if you want to see how long the execution took
use `:set +s` in GHCi console
